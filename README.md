[00:13.69] I don't feel as if I know you
[00:16.82] You take up all my time
[00:20.08] The days are long and the night will throw you away
[00:23.73] Coz the sun don't shine
[00:26.58] Nobody ever mentions the weather can
[00:29.85] make or break your day
[00:33.03] Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play
[00:59.03] 
[00:40.37] We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
[00:45.67] And it's never gonna be the same
[00:48.75] Cos the years are falling by like the rain
[00:51.96] And it's never gonna be the same
[00:54.96] 'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says
[01:18.46] 
[00:58.35] Hello
[01:00.85] 
[01:05.07] There ain't no sense in feeling lonely
[01:08.32] They got no faith in you
[01:20.32] 
[01:09.69] There ain't no sense in feeling lonely
[01:10.53] They got no faith in you
[01:11.55] But I've got a feeling you still owe me
[01:14.85] So wipe the shit from your shoes
[01:18.18] Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
[01:24.63] Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play
[01:50.63] 
[01:31.82] We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
[01:37.04] And it's never gonna be the same
[01:40.20] Cos the years are falling by like the rain
[01:43.48] And it's never gonna be the same
[01:46.57] 'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says
[02:10.07] 
[01:54.62] Hello
[01:57.12] 
[01:55.13] Hello!
[01:56.32] Hello!
[01:59.21] Hello!
[02:00.69] Hello!
[02:00.81] It's good to be back
